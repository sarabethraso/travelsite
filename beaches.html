	<h1> Touristy Beaches You Should Save on </h1>
	  
	  <h3> 1.&nbsp; Destin, Florida</h3>
	  
    <p> <img src="destin.png" width="525" height="186" alt="" class="backColor"></p>
	  
    <p>Destin while it is super pretty is incredibly busy and the areas around the beach are super dirty. The times I've gone its been super busy to where you would have to reserve a spot on the beach for almost $150 for 4 people. The resorts by Destin are very nice to stay at however, all the pools are clean and theres many events and at the specfic resort I stayed at there was a cafe, gift shop, swim store, 2 restaurants, and an open bar.</p>
	  
	  <p>I say stay at a resort in Destin and drive about 10 minutes down the road to Princess beach, you get the same super white beaches and super blue ocean with half the people. On the way to Princess theres so many cool shops and restraunts that you should defenintly give a shot! </p>
	  
	  <h3> 2. Mrytle Beach, South Carolina </h3>
